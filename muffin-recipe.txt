YIELDMakes 12 muffins
INGREDIENTS
2 cups white flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons sugar
1 egg, slightly beaten
1 cup milk
1/4 cup melted butter

PREPARATION
Preheat the oven to 375°F. Butter muffin pans. Mix the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a large bowl.

Pecan Muffins.
Use 1/4 cup sugar. Add 1/2 cup chopped pecans to the batter. After filling the cups, sprinkle with sugar, cinnamon, and more chopped nuts.

Date or Raisin Muffins.
Add 1/2 cup chopped pitted dates or 1/3 cup raisins to the batter.
